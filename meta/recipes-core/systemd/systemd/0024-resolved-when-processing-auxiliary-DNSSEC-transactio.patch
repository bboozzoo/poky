Subject: [PATCH 2/2] resolved: when processing auxiliary DNSSEC transactions,
 accept those with SERVFAIL

Some upstream DNS servers return SERVFAIL if we ask them for DNSSEC RRs, which
some forwarding DNS servers pass on to us as SERVFAIL (other though as
NOERROR...). This is should not be considered a problem, as long as the domain
in question didn't have DNSSEC enabled. Hence: when making use of auxiliary
transactions accept those that return SERVFAIL.
