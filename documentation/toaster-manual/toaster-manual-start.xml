<title>Preparing to Use Toaster</title>

    <para>
        This chapter describes how you need to prepare your system in order to
        use Toaster.
        Toaster requires some packages that you must have installed before
        trying to run Toaster.

        <title>Setting Up the Basic System Requirements</title>

        <para>
            You first need to be sure your build system is set up to run
            the Yocto Project.
            See the
            "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_QS_URL;#yp-resources'>What You Need and How You Get It</ulink>"
            section in the Yocto Project Quick Start for information on how
            to set up your system for the Yocto Project.

        <title>Establishing Toaster System Dependencies</title>

        <para>
            Toaster requires extra Python dependencies that Bitbake
            does not need in order to run.
            In order to make it easy to run Toaster, a requirements file
            located in the root directory of
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#source-directory'>Source Directory</ulink>
            <filename>bitbake/</filename>
            (e.g. <filename>poky/bitbake/toaster-requirements.txt</filename>).
            The dependencies appear in a <filename>pip</filename>,
            install-compatible format:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     Django==1.6
     South==0.8.4
     argparse==1.2.1
     wsgiref==0.1.2
            </literallayout>
            Follow these steps to get set up:
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem><para><emphasis>Install <filename>virtualenv</filename>:</emphasis>
                    <filename>virtualenv</filename> is a tool to create
                    isolated Python environments by creating folders that
                    contain all the necessary executables to use the packages
                    that Python projects need.
                    You can use <filename>pip</filename> to install
                    <filename>virtualenv</filename>:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ pip install virtualenv
                    </literallayout>
                    </para></listitem>
                <listitem><para><emphasis>Create and activate a virtual environment:</emphasis>
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ virtualenv venv
     $ source venv/bin/activate
                    </literallayout>
                    </para></listitem>
                <listitem><para><emphasis>Use <filename>pip</filename> to install needed packages:</emphasis>
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ pip install -r bitbake/toaster-requirements.txt
                    </literallayout>
                    </para></listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            Once you complete these steps, you execute in a lightweight
            "virtual environment‚Äù with its own site directories that are
            optionally isolated from system site directories.
            The virtual environment has its own Python binary
            (allowing creation of environments with various Python versions)
            and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages
            in its site directories.
