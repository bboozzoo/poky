<title>Setting Up and Using Toaster</title>

    <para>
        You can set up Toaster as a local instance or as a hosted service.
        Furthermore, you can use Toaster in Analysis Mode or Build Mode
        from both set ups.

            <para>
                A hosted service resides on a server and allows
                multiple users to take advantage of Toaster.
                In a production environment, you might want to have multiple
                local instances of Toaster, which run on various remote
                build machines, and have those local instances access and use
                a single hosted Toaster service.
            </para>

            <para>
                Starting Toaster with the <filename>toaster</filename> command
                (i.e. the script), causes three things to start:

                        The BitBake server.
                        </para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para>
                        The Toaster User Interface, which connects to the
                        BitBake server on one side and to the SQL
                        database on the other side.
                        </para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para>
                        The web server, which reads the database and displays
                        the web user interface.
                        </para></listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
                Rather than starting Toaster with the script, you can set up
                and start multiple instances of Toaster by manually starting
                as many or few of these three components across your
                environment.
                This is possible because it is not required that Toaster starts
                all three of its separate components in order to run.
                Minimally, a local instance of Toaster requires just one of the
                components.
            </para>

            <para>
                The concepts for setting up multiple local instances of
                Toaster that share a single hosted service revolve
                around maintaining a common SQL database and Web server that
                shows data from that common database as well as setting up
                separate local instances of BitBake servers and Toaster user
                interfaces for each of those separate BitBake build
                directories.
            </para>

            <para>
                The common SQL database and the Web server show data from
                all the various BitBake builds.
                Setting the SQL database outside of any
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>
                maintains a separation layer between the various local builds
                and the common database.
                The database is persistent because the logging database is set
                up external to the BitBake database server (e.g. MySQL).
                It is not even necessary to run the BitBake servers, the SQL
                server, and the Web server on the same machine.
                Each component can be run on its own machine.

            <note><title>REVIEWER NOTE</title>
               We have agreed to get rid of the manual page on the website,
               contains the links to the GUI videos.
               We have agreed to host the videos on Vimeo and to embed the
               videos in this new Toaster manual.
